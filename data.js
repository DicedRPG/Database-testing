Bean/Lentil Soup: Sauté aromatics thoroughly for flavor base, if using dried beans, ensure they're properly soaked, simmer gently until beans are tender but not mushy, consider pureeing portion for thicker texture. Tomato-Based Soup: Cook onions and garlic thoroughly before adding tomatoes, add pinch of sugar to balance acidity if needed, for creamy version: add cream or blend with bread, consider final acid addition (vinegar, lemon). Pureed Soup: Cook all ingredients until very tender, use immersion blender or regular blender (in batches), strain for extra smoothness if desired, thin with additional broth if too thick, finish with cream, oil, or butter for richness.

Deli Meat Sandwich: Apply spread to both bread slices, layer lettuce or greens against bread to prevent sogginess, fold meats for volume and texture, add cheese, vegetables, and condiments, season each layer with salt and pepper, press lightly before cutting. Vegetable-Focused Sandwich: Remove excess moisture from vegetables, consider roasting vegetables for depth, layer for stability and balance, include protein element (hummus, cheese, egg), add spreads with complementary flavors, season vegetables separately before assembly. Open-Faced Melt: Toast bread before topping, layer fillings, ending with cheese, broil until cheese is melted and bubbly, watch carefully to prevent burning, finish with fresh components after melting. Wrap or Roll-Up: Warm tortilla or wrap for flexibility, apply thin layer of spread to entire surface, arrange fillings on bottom third, don't overfill, fold sides in, then roll from bottom, toast seam-side down to seal if desired.
